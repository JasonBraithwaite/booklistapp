# booklistapp

Using Vanilla JS to create a basic Book List App.

App will allow the user to create and delete a booklist.

App built using plain vanilla JS with no frameworks - built using OOP with ES6 Classes.

App will have a Book class, a UI class and a Store class to store data locally on the browser.

All of the CSS will be handled by Bootstrap using Bootswatch

This was created as part of my learning using a tutorial on JS Vanilla on Youtube by traversymedia - here is the link to the video tutorial for reference: https://youtu.be/JaMCxVWtW58
